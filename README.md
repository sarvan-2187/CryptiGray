# CryptiGray  
**A Web-based Encryption & Decryption System using BCD → Gray Code with Secret Key**  

---

## Overview  
CryptiGray is a lightweight web application that demonstrates how BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) to Gray Code transformation can be applied in data encryption and decryption.  
It uses a two-website model:  
- **Encrypt Site:** Converts plain text → BCD → Gray → XOR with secret key → Ciphertext.  
- **Decrypt Site:** Reverses the process to reconstruct the original message.  

This project is built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it is lightweight, portable, and easy to deploy (GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel).
